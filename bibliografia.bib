abstract={A search is presented for the Higgs boson off-shell production in gluon fusion and vector boson fusion processes with the Higgs boson decaying into a W+W− pair and the W bosons decaying leptonically. The data observed in this analysis are used to constrain the Higgs boson total decay width. The analysis is based on the data collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC, corresponding to integrated luminosities of 4.9 fb−1 at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV and 19.4 fb−1 at 8 TeV, respectively. An observed (expected) upper limit on the off-shell Higgs boson event yield normalised to the standard model prediction of 2.4 (6.2) is obtained at the 95{\%} CL for the gluon fusion process and of 19.3 (34.4) for the vector boson fusion process. Observed and expected limits on the total width of 26 and 66 MeV are found, respectively, at the 95{\%} confidence level (CL). These limits are combined with the previous result in the ZZ channel leading to observed and expected 95{\%} CL upper limits on the width of 13 and 26 MeV, respectively.},

abstract = "The challenges for the tracking detector systems at the LHC are unprecedented in terms of the number of channels, the required read-out speed and the expected radiation levels. The ATLAS Semiconductor Tracker (SCT) end-caps have a total of about 3million electronics channels each reading out every 25ns into its own on-chip 3.3μs buffer. The highest anticipated dose after 10 years operation is 1.4×1014cm-2 in units of 1MeV neutron equivalent (assuming the damage factors scale with the non-ionising energy loss). The forward tracker has 1976 double-sided modules, mostly of area ∼70cm2, each having 2×768 strips read out by six ASICs per side. The requirement to achieve an average perpendicular radiation length of 1.5% X0, while coping with up to 7W dissipation per module (after irradiation), leads to stringent constraints on the thermal design. The additional requirement of 1500e- equivalent noise charge (ENC) rising to only 1800e- ENC after irradiation, provides stringent design constraints on both the high-density Cu/Polyimide flex read-out circuit and the ABCD3TA read-out ASICs. Finally, the accuracy of module assembly must not compromise the 16μm(rφ) resolution perpendicular to the strip directions or 580μm radial resolution coming from the 40mrad front-back stereo angle. A total of 2210 modules were built to the tight tolerances and specifications required for the SCT. This was 234 more than the 1976 required and represents a yield of 93%. The component flow was at times tight, but the module production rate of 40–50 per week was maintained despite this. The distributed production was not found to be a major logistical problem and it allowed additional flexibility to take advantage of where the effort was available, including any spare capacity, for building the end-cap modules. The collaboration that produced the ATLAS SCT end-cap modules kept in close contact at all times so that the effects of shortages or stoppages at different sites could be rapidly resolved."

	abstract = {The ATLAS TRT barrel is a tracking drift chamber using
52,544 individual tubular drift tubes.  It is one part of the ATLAS
Inner Detector, which consists of three sub-systems: the pixel
detector spanning the radius range 4 to 20 cm, the semiconductor
tracker (SCT) from 30 to 52 cm, and the transition radiation tracker
(TRT) from 56 to 108 cm.  The TRT barrel covers the central
pseudo-rapidity region |η|< 1, and the TRT while endcaps cover
the forward and backward eta regions. These TRT systems provide a
combination of continuous tracking with many measurements in
individual drift tubes (or straws) and of electron identification
based on transition radiation from fibers or foils interleaved between
the straws themselves. This paper describes the recently-completed
construction of the TRT Barrel detector, including the quality control
procedures used in the fabrication of the detector.}

4π coverage for high pT particles resulting from proton-proton collisions in the ATLAS
detector at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. Both the technology and the
deployment of the forward calorimeters in ATLAS are novel. The liquid argon rod/tube
electrode structure for the forward calorimeters was invented specifically for
applications in high rate environments. The placement of the forward calorimeters
adjacent to the other calorimeters relatively close to the interaction point provides
several advantages including nearly seamless calorimetry and natural shielding for the
muon system. The forward calorimeter performance requirements are driven by events
with missing ET and tagging jets.}

response to electrons and pions, as measured by the linearity and resolution as a function of energy, 
is extracted and compared to ATLAS performance requirements.}
